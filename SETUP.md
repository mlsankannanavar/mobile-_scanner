## Quick Setup Instructions

### 1. Prerequisites
- Install Flutter SDK (3.19.0 or higher)

   git clone https://github.com/mlsankannanavar/mobile-_scanner.git
   cd mobile-_scanner
   ```

2. **Get Flutter dependencies:**
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Run the app:**
   ```bash

   ```

### 3. GitHub Actions Setup

1. **Push your code to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit: Flutter Text Scanner App"

   ```

2. **Check build status:**
   - Go to your repository: https://github.com/mlsankannanavar/mobile-_scanner
   - Click on the "Actions" tab
   - Wait for the build to complete
   - Download the APK from the "Artifacts" section

### 4. Building APK Locally (Optional)

```bash
flutter build apk --release
```

The APK will be generated at: `build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk`
